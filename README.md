# oder_management
This is an academic project developed during my sephomore year.
The project was conceptualized and designed after completing the DSA course at university.
The main functionalities of the program include:
  Adding, deleting, and updating online order information (manual input).
  Searching orders by customer name and order ID.
  The program saves and load data from data.txt.
The program applies data structures and algorithms such as Binary Search Tree (BST), HashTable, and others to manage and optimize data processing.
